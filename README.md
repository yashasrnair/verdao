# 🌿 VerdAO — Decentralized Carbon Credit Quality Governance DAO

> Empowering the planet, one vote at a time.

---

## 🔥 Overview

**VerdAO** is a fully decentralized governance platform built on **BNBChain**, designed to fight **greenwashing** by enabling global communities, NGOs, and eco-conscious corporations to vote on and set **carbon credit quality standards** transparently.

Built during the **BNB Hackathon at Kochi**, VerdAO transforms the way carbon credits are validated — shifting trust from centralized authorities to a DAO-driven ecosystem backed by **$VERD**, **$CGT**, and **$CRT** tokens.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Anonymous Voting** using $CGT governance tokens
- 📊 **Transparent Proposals** to define and refine carbon standards
- 🌎 **Community-Driven** with staking incentives for participation
- 🛡️ **Greenwashing Detection** through collective vetting
- 💸 **Token-based Rewards** for all participants
- ⚙️ Powered by **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **React + TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **MetaMask**

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**Greenwashing** is rampant — corporations falsely claim to be environmentally responsible. The lack of **transparency**, **standardization**, and **community oversight** in the carbon credit industry allows manipulation.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

VerdAO decentralizes the governance of carbon credit standards using a **voting-based DAO**, powered by custom tokens and smart contracts. The community votes on proposals that define what qualifies as a high-quality carbon credit, reducing risks of fraud and fake offsets.

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Stake $VERD** → Earn $CGT governance tokens
2. **Submit & Vote on Proposals** anonymously
3. **Verify Quality Standards** through DAO consensus
4. **Earn Rewards** in $CRT for active participation

---

## 🖼️ UI/UX Highlights

- 🎛️ **Dashboard**: Real-time proposal status and token metrics
- 🗳️ **Voting Portal**: Fully anonymous with MetaMask
- 💹 **Staking Page**: Claim & stake tokens for influence
- 🛍️ **Marketplace** (Upcoming): Exchange carbon tokens
